Dynamic-EntityFrameWork
=======================

C# Library for dynamic CRUD operations using Entity Frame Work and  Connected database access

Wouldn't it be great to have a method that takes any entity and throws it in your database?
Or to have a method that deletes any entity you give it from the database?
Or to have a method that updates, gets and finds any entity from the database?
